- **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)** - Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
- **[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)** - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. I used this framework for routing.

- **[Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/)** - Sequelize is a promise-based ORM for Node.js which supports the dialects of PostgreSQL and features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.
